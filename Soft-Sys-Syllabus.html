        Assignments for this course will take the form of Programming Projects, Quizzes, <br />Discussion Board topics,
        a class Demonstration, and a Final Project.
        <br /> <br />

        <b><i>Course Grade</b></i> The course grade will be based on the following:<br />
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th bgcolor="#D3D3D3"><b><u>Assignment</u></b></th>

            </tr>
        </table>

        </br></br>

        <b><i>Grading Policies:</b></i> No late assignments will be accepted. It is vastly preferable to <br />
        turn in a partially complete assignment than to turn in a late one. <br /> <br />

        Similarly, it is vastly more beneficially to turn in a programming or lab assignment <br />
        that has 70% of the features fully implemented than to turn in an assignment that <br />
        has 100% of the features partially implemented.
        <br /> <br />
        Final course letter grade will be determined using the following scale:
        <table>

        <b><i>Requests for Reasonable Accommodations:</b></i> <br>
        Lewis University is committed to providing equal access and opportunity for <br>
        participation in all programs, services and activities. If you are a student with a <br>
        disability who would like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak <br>
        with the Learning Access Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and <br>
        Enrichment (CASE). Please make an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or <br>
        emailing <a href="mailto:learningaccess@lewisu.edu">learningaccess@lewisu.edu</a>. Since accommodations require
        early <br>
        planning and are not provided retroactively, it is recommended that you make <br>
        your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is not necessary to <br>
        disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more information <br>
        about academic support services, visit the website at: <a href="www.lewisu.edu/CASE">www.lewisu.edu/CASE</a>.

        <b><i>Academic Integrity</b></i><br>
        Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other<br>
        forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the<br>
        University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and<br>
        expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially<br>
        considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the<br>
        instructor’s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level.<br>
        Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the<br>
        college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases<br>
        except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the<br>
        Provost makes the final decision.
