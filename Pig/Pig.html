    <h1>The Game of Pig</h1>
    <p><b>How to play:</b> The game is simple. You roll the dice and you will <br>
        land on a number between 1 and 6. You can roll the dice as many <br>
        times as you want. You accumulate points that which you can  <br>
        cash in by ending your turn, which can be seen in the bank. <br>
        This is where the kicker comes in. <u>If you roll a 1, the bank is reset to 0 <br>
        and you lose your turn; thus, getting no points.</u> <br>
        First to 100 points wins. Pressing "New Game" Resets all the scores. GLHF.
